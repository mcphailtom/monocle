Monocle is a TUI that runs alongside your AI coding agent. You review diffs in real time as the agent writes code, leave line-level comments — issues, suggestions, notes — and submit a structured review in one batch. The agent receives your feedback and starts fixing things immediately, just like a PR review but live.

Monocle connects to your agent using Unix sockets. But with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and [MCP channels](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels-reference), it's able to push feedback directly into the agent's context the moment you submit. Other agents — [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli) — can still use skills or bash tools to retrieve feedback from monocle after it's been submitted and queued. MCP channels just make the process smoother.

## Why

Without something like Monocle, reviewing agent-written code means rubber-stamping diffs you didn't read, copy-pasting feedback into a chat window, or just hoping the agent got it right. There's no way to say "fix these three issues and show me again."

Monocle gives you a proper review loop without slowing the agent down. It doesn't gate each file change behind an approval — your agent keeps working while you review at your own pace. When you're ready, leave line-level comments and submit. The agent receives your feedback immediately and starts addressing it. You see the updated diffs, review again, and iterate — like PR reviews, but in real time.

## Requirements

- A coding agent: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli), or any agent that supports [agent skills](https://agentskills.io)
- A terminal with 256-color or true color support
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for file icons (optional but recommended)

## Quick Start

### 1. Register Monocle with your agent

```bash
monocle register          # interactive picker
monocle register claude   # or: opencode, codex, gemini, all
```

This installs skills and, for Claude Code, the MCP channel config for push notifications. Use `--global` to write to the user-level config directory instead of the project.

| Agent       | Skills              | MCP config  |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/`   | `.mcp.json` |
| OpenCode    | `.opencode/skills/` | -           |
| Codex CLI   | `.codex/skills/`    | -           |
| Gemini CLI  | `.gemini/skills/`   | -           |

#### Other agents

If your agent isn't natively supported, you can set up Monocle manually:

- **MCP tools**: If your agent supports MCP servers via stdio, point it at `monocle serve-mcp`. This exposes review tools (`review_status`, `get_feedback`, `send_artifact`, `add_files`) over stdio.
- **Skills**: Download `skills.tar.gz` from the [latest release](https://github.com/josephschmitt/monocle/releases/latest) and extract the skill files into wherever your agent expects its skills.

### 2. Start reviewing

Start your agent and Monocle in separate terminals:

```bash
monocle
```

For Claude Code, Monocle registers an MCP server that exposes review tools directly — no bash permissions or skills needed. Other agents get [skills](#skills) that instruct them to run CLI commands.

#### Push notifications (Claude Code only)

Claude Code supports [MCP channels](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels-reference), which deliver feedback automatically. When you submit a review, a push notification prompts the agent to retrieve your feedback immediately instead of waiting for the next poll.

> **Tip:** If you start or restart Monocle while Claude Code is already running, the MCP server may need to reconnect. Type `/mcp` in Claude Code and select Monocle to reconnect.

### The review loop

Navigate with `j`/`k`, add comments with `c`, and use `v` for visual (multi-line) selections. Press `?` to see all keybindings, or see the full [Keybindings](#keybindings) reference.

**Submit** (`S`): Your review is formatted and queued for delivery. With Claude Code channels, a push notification prompts the agent to retrieve it immediately. With other agents, the review waits in the queue until the agent runs `/get-feedback` or calls `monocle review get-feedback`. Multiple reviews can accumulate in the queue — the agent receives them all combined when it pulls. If there are no comments, the review is treated as an approval. Toggle the "Copy to clipboard" checkbox with `Shift+Tab` in the submit modal to also copy the formatted review when submitting.

**External editor** (`Ctrl+g`): In the comment or submit modal, opens the current text in your `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` (falls back to `vi`). Edit in your preferred editor, save and quit, and the text is brought back into the modal.

**Yank** (`Ctrl+y`): In the submit modal, copies the formatted review to your system clipboard without submitting, then closes the modal.

**Pause** (`P`): The agent receives a push notification to stop and wait. It runs `monocle review get-feedback --wait` and blocks until you submit your review. This is for when you want to review before the agent moves on. Pause requires MCP channel support (currently Claude Code only).

### Plan review and focus mode

Monocle isn't limited to reviewing file changes. Your agent can submit **plans, architecture decisions, summaries, and other content** directly to Monocle for review using `monocle review send-artifact`. These show up alongside your file diffs in the sidebar, and you can leave line-level comments on them the same way. You can also trigger this yourself with the `/review-plan` or `/review-plan-wait` skills — useful when you want to send the agent's plan to Monocle without waiting for the agent to do it on its own.

This means you can review the agent's *thinking* before it writes code — not just the output. Ask the agent to submit its content first, review it, leave feedback, and only then let it proceed.

The `/review-plan-wait` skill submits content to your TUI **and blocks** until you respond with feedback. If you approve, the agent continues. If you request changes, the agent updates and submits again — iterating across as many rounds as it takes until you're satisfied.

> **Note:** Monocle's skills are available to your agent but the agent decides when to use them on its own. If you want the agent to automatically submit plans for review, add instructions to your agent's project configuration. See [Automatic content review](#automatic-content-review) below for a suggested prompt.

## Features

- **Works with any coding agent** — Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or any MCP-compatible agent
- **Push notifications** — With Claude Code channels, feedback is pushed directly into the agent's context the moment you submit
- **Pull-based feedback** — Agents without channel support retrieve feedback via the `/get-feedback` skill or `monocle review get-feedback`; multiple reviews queue up and are delivered together
- **Plan & architecture review** — Your agent can submit plans, architecture decisions, and other content for review with markdown rendering. When iterating, Monocle shows diffs between plan versions so you can see exactly what changed. Use focus mode (`F`) for distraction-free reading
- **Review gating** — `/review-plan-wait` blocks the agent until you approve the submitted content before it proceeds
- **Pause flow** — Ask your agent to stop and wait while you review, then release it when ready (requires MCP channel support)
- **Live diff viewer** — Unified and split (side-by-side) views with syntax highlighting and intra-line diffs
- **Structured comments** — Tag feedback as issues, suggestions, notes, or praise with line-level or file-level precision
- **Suggested edits** — Press `s` to propose exact code changes with GitHub-style `suggestion` blocks
- **Visual selection** — Select line ranges for comments with vim-style visual mode
- **Markdown rendering** — Plans and changed `.md` files render with styled headings, bold, italic, lists, and code blocks
- **Horizontal scrolling & line wrapping** — Navigate wide diffs with `h`/`l` or toggle wrapping with `w`
- **Responsive layout** — Automatically stacks panes vertically in narrow terminals
- **Ref picker** — Change the base ref on the fly to compare against any branch or commit
- **Version history** — Browse all versions of a plan or artifact and diff any version against the latest
- **Comment resolution** — Mark individual comments as resolved (`x`); resolved comments are excluded from submitted reviews
- **Submission history** — View past review submissions with `:history`
- **Mouse support** — Click to focus panes, scroll with the wheel, click files to select, drag to make visual selections, and interact with modal controls
- **External editor** — Open comment or submit text in `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` with `Ctrl+g` for full editing power
- **Configurable keybindings** — Override any navigation or action key via config
- **Feedback queue** — Submit reviews while the agent is working; delivered when the agent next runs `/get-feedback`
- **Connection indicator** — See at a glance whether your agent is connected, with manual socket override for troubleshooting
- **Review tracking** — Mark files as reviewed with `r` (auto-advances to next), filter sidebar to show only unreviewed or reviewed files with `/`, and all reviewed states reset on submit
- **Session persistence** — Reviews survive restarts via SQLite

## CLI

```
monocle [--socket PATH]              Start a review session
monocle register [agent] [--global]  Register Monocle for an agent
monocle unregister [agent] [--global] Remove Monocle registration
monocle --version                    Print version
```

The `agent` argument is one of `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `gemini`, or `all`. If omitted, an interactive picker lets you select which agents to register. The `--global` flag writes to the user-level config directory instead of the project.

### Agent-Facing Commands

These commands are used by agents (via skills) to interact with a running Monocle session:

```
monocle review status [--json]                          Check review status
monocle review get-feedback [--wait] [--json]            Retrieve review feedback
monocle review send-artifact --title T [--file F] [--id ID] [--type EXT] [--wait] [--json]
                                                         Send content for review
monocle review add-files <paths...> [--json]             Add files to review session
```

- `--wait` blocks until the reviewer responds (used by `/review-plan-wait` skill)
- `--json` outputs structured JSON for programmatic use
- `send-artifact` reads from `--file` or stdin

### Manual Socket Override

If auto-pairing fails (e.g., the agent's working directory differs from Monocle's), you can manually specify the socket path:

- **Monocle:** `monocle --socket /tmp/monocle-abc123.sock`
- **Agent commands:** `MONOCLE_SOCKET=/tmp/monocle-abc123.sock monocle review status`
- **MCP channel (Claude):** Set `MONOCLE_SOCKET` in `.mcp.json` env

Press `I` in the TUI to see the current socket path and connection status.

## Configuration

Monocle loads settings from JSON config files:

1. **Global:** `~/.config/monocle/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/monocle/config.json`)
2. **Project:** `.monocle/config.json` in the working directory (overrides global)

```json
{
  "layout": "auto",
  "diff_style": "unified",
  "sidebar_style": "flat",
  "wrap": false,

Toggle keybindings (`T`, `t`, `w`, `f`) change settings for the current session only. Edit the config file to persist your preferences.

### Custom Keybindings

Override any action key by mapping the action name to a new key string:

```json
{
  "keybindings": {
    "quit": "Q",
    "submit": "ctrl+s",
    "scroll_down": "ctrl+j"
  }
}
```

Available action names: `up`, `down`, `top`, `bottom`, `half_up`, `half_down`, `prev_file`, `next_file`, `select`, `focus_swap`, `toggle_sidebar`, `scroll_down`, `scroll_up`, `scroll_left`, `scroll_right`, `scroll_home`, `scroll_first_char`, `scroll_end`, `wrap`, `toggle_diff`, `tree_mode`, `collapse_all`, `expand_all`, `prev_section`, `next_section`, `comment`, `file_comment`, `suggest`, `visual`, `reviewed`, `submit`, `pause`, `dismiss_outdated`, `base_ref`, `cycle_layout`, `refresh`, `help`, `quit`, `command_mode`.

The help overlay (`?`) dynamically reflects your custom bindings. Modal keys (Enter, Esc, Tab in overlays) are not configurable.

## Automatic content review

By default, Monocle's skills are available to your agent but the agent decides when to use them on its own. If you want the agent to automatically submit plans or other content for review, add instructions to your agent's project configuration (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.):

````markdown
## Monocle Integration

When Monocle is running:
- Use the `/review-plan` skill to send content (plans, decisions, summaries) for the reviewer to see
- Use the content's filename as the identifier so updates replace the previous version
- In plan mode, use `/review-plan-wait` instead — it blocks until the reviewer responds. If they request changes, update and resubmit until approved.
````

You can also use the `/review-plan` and `/review-plan-wait` skills manually at any time.

## How it works

```
┌─────────────┐                ┌───────────────┐              ┌──────────┐
│   Agent     │<--stdio/MCP--->│  channel.ts   │<---socket--->│ monocle  │
│             │                │ (MCP server)  │              │  (TUI)   │
└─────────────┘                └───────────────┘              └──────────┘
```

1. You leave line-level comments on diffs — issues, suggestions, notes, praise
2. You press `S` to submit your review
3. Monocle queues the review for delivery
4. The agent picks up the feedback — automatically via push notification (Claude Code with channels) or when you trigger `/get-feedback` — and starts addressing your comments
5. You see the updated diffs in real time, review again, and iterate

Feedback is always queued for reliability. How the agent learns about it depends on the integration:

- **Claude Code with channels:** A push notification is sent through the MCP channel with a summary of the review (e.g., "Your reviewer requested changes — 2 issues, 1 suggestion"). The agent runs `/get-feedback` to retrieve the full review. If the push fails silently (channels not enabled), the review stays in the queue.
- **Any agent:** The agent calls `monocle review get-feedback` via a skill or CLI command, either via a `/get-feedback` slash command or on its own. Multiple reviews accumulate in the queue and are delivered together.

If you want the agent to pause and wait for you to finish reviewing, press `P` — the agent receives a pause notification and blocks until your review is ready.
