# Get Review Feedback

## Prerequisite

Run `monocle status` to check if Monocle is active. If the output is "not running", **do not execute this skill**. Instead, let the user know that Monocle is not running, and they can start it with `monocle` if they'd like to use it for this session.

## Usage

Run `monocle review get-feedback` to retrieve pending review feedback.

## Handling the response

- If feedback is available, read it carefully and act on it — the feedback contains your reviewer's comments, issues, and suggestions about your code changes
- If no feedback is pending, inform the user that no review feedback is available yet

After receiving feedback, address the reviewer's comments in your code, then continue with your work.
